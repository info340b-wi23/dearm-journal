            Many people are not able to recall their dreams or they are only able to remember small pieces of it. When someone dreams, it is a series of images, thoughts, and sensations that occur in the mind during sleep. Dreaming is a very important step in sleeping that many people may overlook. Dreams can also provide insight into unconscious thoughts, feelings, and desire. For someone to truly understand themselves they must understand what they are dreaming about and how that may have an impact on your life. Studies have also shown that people who dream about a task they have learned, perform better on that task the next day. Also keeping a dream journal can improve memory by helping to solidify dream memories and make them more accessible. Writing down dreams immediately upon waking can help to preserve the details and emotions of the dream before they fade away. The act of writing can also help to process the dream and connect it to waking life experiences. So being able to remember your dreams and understand them can ultimately help you get a better understanding of certain aspects of life in the real world. This is why the Dream Journal app would be very beneficial for a lot of people.
